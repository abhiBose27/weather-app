### Weather App

#### About the Project

A simple and responsive weather app built using HTML, CSS and javascript.
It uses OpenWeatherMapAPI to fetch Temperature, Weather, Humidity & Wind speed details.

#### Why I chose this Project?
In terms of front-end dev, there was not much to do. But this project led me to interact with OpenWeatherMap API.
